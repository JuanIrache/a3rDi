Audio-Assisted Sensory Photography for the Blind (created in 2013, uploaded now)

Video explaining the project here: https://youtu.be/w3Fl9vFYzts

This was a Multimedia project for COFA (UNSW), while I was starting to code. Take that into account when working with it. The code is extremely spaghetti and does things like 3D mapping from scratch (by trial and error) instead of using the appropriate libraries.

I'm posting it for reference, and maybe in case anyone is still trying to work with the Minoru 3D webcam. The sketch worked acceptably well considering all the conditions (low quality stereo camera and low quality developer ), but had to be fine tuned every time it was used, so it is not really convenient for real-world use.

Preparation:
- You need a Minoru 3D Webcam
- A PC laptop (I'm not sure the Minoru worked on anything else)
- Processing 2 (not working on 3 last time I checked)
- Patience

I might be forgetting something. This was a long time ago. Feel free to ask.
